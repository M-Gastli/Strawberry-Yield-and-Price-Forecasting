# Strawberry-Yield-and-Price-Forecasting

This project explores the use of remote sensing satellite images and Deep Learning models for forecasting daily strawberry yield and price in California.

The methodology of obtaining and preprocessing the satellite images is based on the method proposed by Jiaxuan You et al. in "Deep Gaussian Process for Crop Yield Prediction Based on Remote Sensing Data", available at: https://github.com/JiaxuanYou/crop_yield_prediction.
